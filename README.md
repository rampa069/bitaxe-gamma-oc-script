# Bitaxe Gamma Overclock Script

This Python script automates overclocking for the Bitaxe Gamma 601 running AxeOS.  
It sweeps through frequency and core voltage combinations while monitoring hashrate, 
stability, and temperature ‚Äî helping you tune your miner safely and effectively.

> ‚öôÔ∏è While this script is preconfigured with voltage and frequency ranges optimized for the Gamma 601,
> it can also be adapted for other Bitaxe models like the Supra or Ultra ‚Äî just update the config section accordingly.

## üîß What It Does

- Adjusts core voltage (mV) and frequency (MHz) in defined increments
- Measures hashrate and temperature via the AxeOS local REST API
- Detects instability using standard deviation and coefficient of variation
- Performs confirmation checks before increasing voltage
- Stops automatically if temperature exceeds a safe limit
- Logs all results to a clean CSV file for review

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer
- `requests` module (`pip install requests`)
- A Bitaxe running AxeOS, accessible on your local network

Tested on:
- Ubuntu/Linux
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- macOS (works with any terminal that supports Python)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Clone This Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/terminally-challenged/bitaxe-gamma-oc-script.git
cd bitaxe-gamma-oc-script
```

### Option 2: Manual Download
- Click the green **Code** button
- Select **Download ZIP**
- Extract the contents and open the script in any text editor (VS Code, Notepad, nano, vim, etc.)

## üõ† Setup Instructions

1. Open the script and update the IP address for your Bitaxe:
   ```python
   MINER_IP = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_BITAXE_IP"
   # Example: MINER_IP = "192.168.1.100"
   ```

2. (Optional) You can customize:
   - Frequency range: `FREQ_START`, `FREQ_END`
   - Core voltage range: `CV_START`, `CV_MAX`
   - Temperature safety limit (e.g., 60¬∞C)
   - Stability thresholds

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 bitaxe_oc_script.py
   ```

4. Allow a couple of hours for a full sweep. Results will be saved in:
   ```
   bitaxe_tuning_results.csv
   ```

This file will give you a solid understanding of your most efficient and stable configuration ‚Äî if the final result isn't already the best one.

## üìù Notes

1. Make sure you‚Äôre on the correct network and using the correct IP address!
2. You can safely exit the script at any time using `Ctrl+C`
3. If using a board **other than Gamma 601**, update the frequency and voltage ranges appropriately in the config section.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: Due to the nature of the ASIC lottery, results may vary slightly between 
units ‚Äî even with identical models. Some fine-tuning may be required to dial in the best results 
for your specific hardware. I've personally tested and adjusted parameters across multiple 
Gamma 601's to find what works best.
